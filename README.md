üëã Hi, I'm Abhishek Kumar
A passionate Machine Learning Engineer and Data Analyst with a knack for solving real-world problems using data and AI. I recently completed my Master of Computer Application, and I have hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning models for tasks like fruit classification and house price prediction.

üîß What I Work On:
Machine Learning & AI: From predictive modeling to data-driven solutions, I love exploring how data can be transformed into intelligent insights.
Deep Learning: Specializing in CNNs, NLP, and advanced machine learning techniques for practical use cases.
Data Science: I enjoy working with data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights.


üíª Tech Stack:
Languages: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS
Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Flask, Pandas, NumPy
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Oracle Cloud, Streamlit


üîç Projects I'm Proud Of:
Fruit Classification using CNN: Built a custom CNN to classify fruits into multiple categories with high accuracy.
House Price Prediction: Developed a web app to predict house prices using machine learning models and Flask.
I‚Äôm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to open-source projects. Let‚Äôs connect and build something amazing together!
