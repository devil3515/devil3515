üëã **Hi, I'm Abhishek Kumar**  
A passionate **Machine Learning Enthusiast** with a knack for solving real-world problems using data and AI. I recently completed my Master of Computer Application, and I have hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning models for tasks like **Fruit classification using CNN** and **Twitter sentiment analysis**.

### üîß **What I Work On:**
- **Machine Learning & AI**: From predictive modeling to data-driven solutions, I love exploring how data can be transformed into intelligent insights.
- **Deep Learning**: Specializing in **CNNs**, **NLP**, and advanced machine learning techniques for practical use cases.
- **Data Science**: I enjoy working with data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights.

### üíª **Tech Stack:**
- **Languages**:
  - Python
  - SQL
  - HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - Scikit-learn
  - Flask
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - Git
  - Oracle Cloud
  - Streamlit

### üîç **Projects I'm Proud Of:**
- **Fruit Classification using CNN**: Built a custom CNN to classify fruits into multiple categories with high accuracy.
- **Twitter sentiment analysis**: Built an web app which can detect if a Tweet is a posotive or a negative tweet.
- **Cold Email generator**: Built a web app for personal use which can build a cold email based on the job description provided by the link of the Job.
- **House Price Prediction**: Developed a web app to predict house prices using machine learning models and Flask.
